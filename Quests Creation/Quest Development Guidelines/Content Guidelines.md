### **Planning your quest**

Things to think about: 

**Level**

- Who is your intended audience? What is experience level is your quest suitable for (beginner/intermediate/advanced)?
- What is the prerequisite knowledge required to successfully complete the quest?

**Skills** 

- What skill topics is your quest related to?
- What can developers expect that they will be able to DO after they complete this quest?

**Quest Task**

- What is the main goal developers need to achieve in this quest?
- Is this a common task developers face?
- Is this task something developers commonly struggle with? What types of mistakes are common?
- Why is it important for developers to know how to do this? What could be a potential outcome of doing it wrong in the real world?

**Quest scenario** 

- In what context might a developer need to complete this task in the real world?
- Is the scenario you’ve chosen realistic? Common? Interesting?

**Steps** 

- What are the steps required to complete the task?
- Do the steps align with the defined learning objectives?
- Does the order of steps make sense?
- What does the user need to do in each step, and how will you verify that the step has been completed successfully?
- Are there any tests you need to write to check users’ work?
- What hints can you provide to help users if they get stuck? (Each step should have at least one hint)
- What would a textbook solution look like?

**Quest Duration** 

- How long do you think it will take developers to complete the quest?
- How long would it take you to perform this task, if you were doing it for the first time?

### **Writing the Quest Texts**

**Narrative**

When building a new quest, you’ll be able to use one of the following [characters](https://www.notion.so/NPC-Bots-6671173242574459ba1b21ea6fe0ed46) to communicate with users: 

- **[Lucca](https://www.notion.so/Lucca-54475518bae544e2823d053106655fc0)**
- **[Keen](https://www.notion.so/Keen-19a5919b153645f1b13a897d21ffe236)**

To make your quest feel more like a conversation with a real human, make sure that conversation texts align with the voice and tone of each character. 

Adjust delay time between messages to make the speed of the conversation feel realistic and give users enough time to read each message. 

**Conversation Texts**

When writing the conversation texts, it is best to read the texts aloud to yourself and ask yourself: 

- Are instructions worded clearly?
- Is all necessary information provided? (ex: definition of acronyms, links to information about terminology/concepts that may be unfamiliar to some users)
- Is there any extraneous text that can be cut out?
- Does the conversation read out as a dialogue or a long monologue?
- Is text formatted properly to highlight instructions, code, etc.? [Learn more](https://github.com/trywilco/wilcosdk/blob/main/Quests%20Creation/Actions%20%26%20Conditions%20APIs/Text%20Formatting.md)

**Feedback** 

The feedback users receive throughout the quest is not only an opportunity to let users know if they did something right or wrong. Frequent meaningful can help users stay engaged in the quest, point them in the right direction when they make a mistake and build their confidence.
